<p>
Labor-AI is a joint initiative of Hadassah Mount Scopus Medical Center and the Hebrew University of Jerusalem. Our lab is dedicated to improving maternal and neonatal outcomes by developing data-driven, explainable, and reliable AI tools for obstetric decision-making.
</p>
<p>
Founded and co-led by Dr. Yishai Sompolinsky and Prof. Michal Lipschuetz, the lab integrates clinical expertise in maternal–fetal medicine with advanced machine learning methodologies, epidemiology, and biomedical informatics. Our research spans from real-time labor monitoring and decision-support to long-term perinatal outcome prediction.
</p>
<p>
We emphasize transparent model development, external validation, and integration with national data systems to support safe, equitable, and effective AI deployment in obstetric care.
